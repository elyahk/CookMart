## Concurrency Experiment

### Overview
This iOS app is designed to demonstrate the concept of concurrency and how it can be used to optimize the performance of an app. The app features a simple view that sends four requests sequentially to a server.

### Process
When the user initiates the requests, the app sends the first request and waits for a response before sending the second request. This process continues until all four requests have been sent and received.

By implementing this process sequentially, we can observe how long it takes for each request to be completed and how the performance of the app is affected by the delay between each request. We can also compare this approach to sending all four requests at once and observe the differences in performance.

### Implementation
The app is built with the latest iOS technologies and is designed to be easy to use and understand. The code is well-organized and documented, making it easy for other developers to modify and build upon the app's functionality.
### Conclusion
This experiment provides a practical example of how concurrency can be used to improve the performance of an app. By allowing multiple requests to be processed simultaneously, the overall processing time can be reduced, resulting in a more efficient and responsive app. We hope that this app will be useful to other developers who are interested in learning more about concurrency and its benefits.
